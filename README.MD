# Image Luminance Adjustment

## Description
This is my project 1 from CS6384 Computer Vision in the University of Texas at Dallas

Process: 
RGB â€”> Gamma Correction RGB -> XYZ -> Luv -> L adjusted Luv -> XYZ -> RGB -> Inverse Gamma Correction -> output RGB

## set up
1. environment: Python3
2. package used: cv2
3. put the image and python file in the same folder

## execute command
(format: .py left_range up_range right_range down_range input_image output_image)
```
python proj1_1.py 0.2 0.1 0.8 0.5 fruits.jpg out_2.png
```
performs linear scaling in the Luv domain, and writes the scaled image as output. The scaling in Luv should stretch only the luminance values. Apply linear scaling that would map the smallest L value in the specified window and all values below it
to 0, and the largest L value in the specified window and all values above it to 100.
```
python proj1_2.py 0.2 0.1 0.8 0.5 fruits.jpg out_2.png
```
performs histogram equalization in the Luv domain, and writes the scaled image as output. Histogram equalization in Luv is applied to the luminance values, as computed in the specified window. It requires a discretization step, where the real-valued L is discretized
into 101 values. all L values below the smallest L value in the window should be mapped to 0, and all L value above the largest L value in the window should be mapped to 100.

## assumption and criteria decision
1. Input RGB out of [0,255]
truncate to [0,255]
2. d = 0 (X=0 and Y=0 and Z=0)
formula change to u_ = 4 and v_ = 9 (Original: u_ = 4*X/d and v_ = 9*Y/d)
3. adjusted L = 0 (new L = 0)
formula change to u__ = uw and v__ = vw (Original: u__ = (u + 13*uw*nL) / (13*nL) and v__ = (v + 13*vw*nL) / (13*nL)  )
4. Output RGB out of [0,1]
truncate to [0,1]
5. Output RGB is NaN
set the value to 1
